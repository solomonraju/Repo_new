OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE OR
OTHERWISE AS TO ANY MATTER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS,
INTEGRATION, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY
OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

this agreement limits Adobe&rsquo;s liability to you in the
event of death or personal injury resulting from Adobe&rsquo;s

structure to an ideographic script, such as hangul or kana; or (c)
England, if a license to the Software is purchased when you are in
any jurisdiction not described above. The respective courts of
Santa Clara County, California when California law applies, Tokyo
District Court in Japan, when Japanese law applies, and the
competent courts of London, England, when the law of England
applies, shall each have non-exclusive jurisdiction over all
disputes relating to this agreement. This agreement will not be

agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the
validity of the balance of this agreement, which will remain valid
and enforceable according to its terms. This agreement will not
prejudice the statutory rights of any party dealing as a consumer.
For example, for consumers in New Zealand who obtain the Software
for personal, domestic or household use (not business purposes),
this agreement is subject to the Consumer Guarantees Act. This
agreement may only be modified by a writing signed by an authorized
officer of Adobe. The English version of this agreement will be the
version used when interpreting or construing this agreement. This

Software and it supersedes any prior representations, discussions,
undertakings, communications or advertising relating to the
Software.</p>
<p class="c4"><b>12. Notice to U.S. Government End
Users.</b></p>
<p class="c5">12.1 Commercial Items. The Software
and Documentation are "Commercial Item(s)," as that term is defined
at 48 C.F.R. Section 2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer
Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation," as such
terms are used in 48 C.F.R. &sect;12.212 or 48 C.F.R.
&sect;227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
&sect;12.212 or 48 C.F.R. Sections 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4,
as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial
Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S.
Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only
those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the
terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the
copyright laws of the United States. Adobe Systems Incorporated,
345 Park Avenue, San Jose, CA 95110-2704, USA.</p>
<p class="c5">12.2 U.S. Government Licensing of
Adobe Technology. You agree that when licensing Adobe Software for
acquisition by the U.S. Government, or any contractor therefore,
you will license consistent with the policies set forth in 48
C.F.R. Section 12.212 (for civilian agencies) and 48 C.F.R.
Sections 227-7202-1 and 227-7202-4 (for the Department of Defense).
For U.S. Government End Users, Adobe agrees to comply with all
applicable equal opportunity laws including, if appropriate, the
provisions of Executive Order 11246, as amended, Section 402 of the
Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (38 USC
4212), and Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
amended, and the regulations at 41 CFR Parts 60-1 through 60-60,

its authorized representative you will within thirty (30) days
fully document and certify that use of any and all Adobe software

licenses from Adobe.</p>
<p class="c4"><b>14. Specific Provisions and
Exceptions.</b> This section sets forth
specific provisions related to certain products and components of
the Software as well as limited exceptions to the above terms and
conditions. To the extent that any provision in this section is in
conflict with any other term or condition in this agreement, this
section will supersede such other term or condition.</p>
<p class="c5">14.1 Limited Warranty for Users
Residing in Germany or Austria. If you obtained the Software in
Germany or Austria, and you usually reside in such country, then
Section 6 does not apply; instead, Adobe warrants that the Software
provides the functionalities set forth in the Documentation (the
"agreed upon functionalities") for the limited warranty period
following receipt of the Software when used on the recommended
hardware configuration. As used in this Section, "limited warranty
period" means one (1) year if you are a business user and two (2)
years if you are not a business user. Non-substantial variation
from the agreed upon functionalities will not and does not
establish any warranty rights. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY
TO SOFTWARE PROVIDED TO YOU FREE OF CHARGE, FOR EXAMPLE, UPDATES,
PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, PRODUCT SAMPLER AND NOT FOR RESALE
(NFR) COPIES OF SOFTWARE, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE CONVERTED INTO OTHER
FORMATS, WEB SITES, ONLINE SERVICES, CD SERVICES OR SOFTWARE THAT
HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU, TO THE EXTENT SUCH ALTERATION CAUSED A
DEFECT. To make a warranty claim, during the limited warranty
period you must return, at our expense, the Software and proof of
purchase to the location where you obtained it. If the
functionalities of the Software vary substantially from the agreed
upon functionalities, Adobe is entitled -- by way of re-performance
and at its own discretion -- to repair or replace the Software. If
this fails, you are entitled to a reduction of the purchase price
(reduction) or to cancel the purchase agreement (rescission). For
further warranty information, please contact the Adobe Customer
Support Department.</p>
<p class="c5">14.2 Limitation of Liability for
Users Residing in Germany and Austria.</p>
<p class="c5">14.2.1 If you obtained the Software
in Germany or Austria, and you usually reside in such country, then
Section 8 does not apply. Instead, subject to the provisions in
Section 14.2.2, Adobe and its affiliates' statutory liability for
damages will be limited as follows: (i) Adobe and its affiliates
will be liable only up to the amount of damages as typically
foreseeable at the time of entering into the purchase agreement in
respect of damages caused by a slightly negligent breach of a
material contractual obligation and (ii) Adobe and its affiliates
will not be liable for damages caused by a slightly negligent
breach of a non-material contractual obligation.</p>
<p class="c5">14.2.2 The aforesaid limitation of
liability will not apply to any mandatory statutory liability, in
particular, to liability under the German Product Liability Act,
liability for assuming a specific guarantee or liability for
culpably caused personal injuries.</p>
<p class="c5">14.2.3 You are required to take all
reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages, in particular to
make back-up copies of the Software and your computer data subject
to the provisions of this agreement.</p>
<p class="c5">14.3 Pre-release Software Additional

been digitally signed using (a) the Software CD feature set; (b) a

Provider. "CD Service Provider" is an independent third party
service vendor listed at <a target="ADB-ESG" href=
"http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html">http://www.adobe.com/security/partners_cds.html</a>

certificates issued by such CD Service Provider for use with the
Software&rsquo;s CD feature set; (b) services related to
issuance of certificates; and (c) other services related to

Statement" means the terms and conditions under which each CD
Service Provider offers CD Services (see the links on
<a target="ADB-ESG" href=

), including for example any subscriber agreements, relying party
agreements, certificate policies and practice statements, and
Section 14.11 of this agreement. By validating a CD using CD
Services, you acknowledge and agree that (a) the certificate used
to digitally sign a CD may be revoked at the time of verification,
making the digital signature on the CD appear valid when in fact it
is not; (b) the security or integrity of a CD may be compromised
due to an act or omission by the signer of the CD, the applicable
CD Service Provider, or any other third party; and (c) you must
read, understand, and be bound by the applicable Issuer
Statement.</p>
<p class="c5">14.11.3 Warranty Disclaimer and
Limitation of Liability. CD Service Providers offer CD Services

liabilities, losses, actions, damages, or claims (including all
reasonable expenses, costs, and attorneys fees) arising out of or
relating to any use of, or reliance on, any CD Service, including,
without limitation (a) reliance on an expired or revoked
certificate; (b) improper verification of a certificate; (c) use of
a certificate other than as permitted by any applicable Issuer
Statement, this agreement or applicable law; (d) failure to
exercise reasonable judgment under the circumstances in relying on
the CD Services; or (e) failure to perform any of the obligations
